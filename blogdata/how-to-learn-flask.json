    "content": "Flask (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior. JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects. <h1 style=\"color: #5e9ca0;\">You can edit <span style=\"color: #2b2301;\">this demo<\/span> text!<\/h1> <h2 style=\"color: #2e6c80;\">How to use the editor:<\/h2> <p>Paste your documents in the visual editor on the left or your HTML code in the source editor in the right. <br \/>Edit any of the two areas and see the other changing in real time.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>Click the <span style=\"background-color: #2b2301; color: #fff; display: inline-block; padding: 3px 10px; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 5px;\">Clean<\/span> button to clean your source code.<\/p> <h2 style=\"color: #2e6c80;\">Some useful features:<\/h2> <ol style=\"list-style: none; font-size: 14px; line-height: 32px; font-weight: bold;\"> <li style=\"clear: both;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/html-online.com\/img\/01-interactive-connection.png\" alt=\"interactive connection\" width=\"45\" \/> Interactive source editor<\/li> <li style=\"clear: both;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/html-online.com\/img\/02-html-clean.png\" alt=\"html cleaner\" width=\"45\" \/> HTML Cleaning<\/li> <li style=\"clear: both;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/html-online.com\/img\/03-docs-to-html.png\" alt=\"Word to html\" width=\"45\" \/> Word to HTML conversion<\/li> <li style=\"clear: both;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/html-online.com\/img\/04-replace.png\" alt=\"replace text\" width=\"45\" \/> Find and Replace<\/li> <li style=\"clear: both;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/html-online.com\/img\/05-gibberish.png\" alt=\"gibberish\" width=\"45\" \/> Lorem-Ipsum generator<\/li> <li style=\"clear: both;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/html-online.com\/img\/6-table-div-html.png\" alt=\"html table div\" width=\"45\" \/> Table to DIV conversion<\/li> <\/ol>",
